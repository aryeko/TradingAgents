The presented analysis on IREN offers a thorough evaluation of both bullish and bearish perspectives, weighted toward a Buy recommendation with sound risk management.

Key positives:
- Doubling GPU capacity and $674M investment underpin strong growth potential.
- Revised ARR forecast over $500M by Q1 2026 shows significant top-line traction.
- Positive technical indicators (rising MAs, EMA surges, MACD) and institutional support highlight strong momentum.
- Sector positioning in AI infrastructure is strategically valuable.
- ESG credentials enhance appeal to broader investor base.

Noted risks:
- RSI near 79 flags short-term overbought risk.
- Doubling ATR indicates heightened volatility.
- Insider selling and macroeconomic uncertainties add caution.
- Lack of full financial transparency is a vigilance point.

Considering these, the balanced approach of initiating or adding to positions gradually while employing stop-losses (~8-10% below entry) is prudent. The plan to monitor fundamental progress and tactically average-in on pullbacks leverages lessons that disciplined patience can mitigate volatility in high-growth stocks.

Hence, this is a calculated Buy recommendation, emphasizing long-term upside while controlling near-term risk.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
