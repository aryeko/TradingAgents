I conducted a search for fundamental information and recent discussions about IREN (Iren SpA) from August 17, 2025, to September 24, 2025, using the Fundamental's platform, which specializes in municipal and public purpose investments. However, no relevant information or fundamental discussions about IREN were found during this period.

The available information indicates that Fundamental's investment focus includes affordable housing, renewable energy, senior care, and infrastructure projects, but IREN did not appear in their recent content or analysis.

For detailed and comprehensive fundamental financial data such as financial documents, company profile, financial history, insider sentiment, insider transactions, and key financial ratios (e.g., P/E, P/S, cash flow), I recommend consulting specialized financial databases or platforms that provide thorough and up-to-date analysis on publicly traded companies, including IREN.

If needed, I can assist in retrieving financial data or other analysis from such sources upon request. 

Please let me know how you would like to proceed or if you want me to try a different approach for obtaining the fundamental information on IREN.
