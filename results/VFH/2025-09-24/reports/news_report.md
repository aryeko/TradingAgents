Here is a comprehensive report on the recent macroeconomic trends and news relevant to trading and the company VFH over the past week ending September 24, 2025:

## Macroeconomic Landscape (September 17-24, 2025)

**1. U.S. Federal Reserve Interest Rate Cut:**
- The Fed cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.25%, the first cut in a year.
- This move reflects easing inflation pressures and a slower U.S. economic growth trajectory.
- Projections imply rates could fall further to around 3.4% by 2026.
- Lower rates generally benefit equities and can boost market liquidity, useful for financial sector stocks like VFH.

**2. Global Economic Growth Outlook:**
- OECD revised upward the 2025 global GDP growth forecast from 2.9% to 3.2%.
- Positive drivers include U.S. artificial intelligence investments and Chinese fiscal interventions.
- However, the OECD notes the full negative impact of U.S. tariffs on global trade and investment remains to be felt.
- Trade tensions might pressure multinational financial firms depending on cross-border activities.

**3. Eurozone Mixed Economic Signals:**
- Eurozone composite PMI shows moderate growth at 51.2 in September.
- Germany's PMI rose strongly to 52.4, reflecting effective fiscal stimulus.
- France's PMI fell to 48.4 amid political instability, indicating contraction.
- These contrasting economies within the Eurozone could influence European financial markets and indirectly impact VFH through exposure to global financial sectors.

**4. Asian Market Volatility:**
- Asian equities declined due to worries about economic slowdown and U.S. rate uncertainty.
- Australia's stocks dropped 1% after above-expected inflation data.
- Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5% on soft manufacturing data.
- Regional economic weakness and inflation surges may result in cautious investor sentiment towards emerging markets.

**5. Sri Lanka Monetary Policy:**
- The central bank held rates steady at 7.75% to balance growth support and inflation control.
- Inflation is low (1.2%) but growth remains healthy (4.8% GDP expansion).
- This indicates some emerging markets may maintain accommodative policies amidst global tightening cycles.
