The investment plan offers a thorough bullish case for VFH based on monetary policy easing, diversification, valuation appeal, and manageable risks from fintech and global trade. The key catalysts—a Fed-driven credit cycle extension and a resilient set of financial institutions—support accumulating a core position now.

Key considerations:
- The suggested core position of 50–60% exposure is prudent, balancing meaningful participation and risk control.
- Adding on pullbacks aligns with a disciplined cost-averaging approach amid macro uncertainties.
- Monitoring credit conditions and loan growth is essential to responding timely to potential credit quality deterioration.
- Diversifying with non-financial holdings reduces cyclical concentration risk.

Given the current fundamental backdrop and valuation, initiating a buy on VFH with a core position consistent with the plan is a sound move. Staying vigilant on credit trends and ready to adjust protects against unforeseen downturns.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
