The company BE (ticker: BE) does not have specific recent news or well-defined social media posts from September 17 to September 24, 2025, based on the available data. The term "BE" can also refer to other topics, such as the BeReal app, which encourages users to share unfiltered daily photos, but no direct connections to the company BE were found in this context.

Given this lack of recent specific social media and news data for BE, traders and investors may want to consider alternative sources such as deeper social media monitoring tools or direct company communications (earnings releases, press statements) for insights.

If you want, I can assist in checking the broader sentiment on related forums or device a deeper analysis based on any available financial data or industry news related to BE.
