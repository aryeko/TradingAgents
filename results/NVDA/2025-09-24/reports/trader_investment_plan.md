The comprehensive analysis and detailed investment plan for NVIDIA (NVDA) indicate a predominantly bullish outlook supported by strong fundamentals and robust growth prospects driven by AI infrastructure, gaming, and data centers. NVIDIA’s strategic partnerships, innovation capacity, and dominant market position bolster its long-term potential despite some near-term risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Given these considerations, adopting a disciplined and measured Buy strategy aligns well with both the technical momentum and fundamental strength highlighted. The incremental position accumulation around support levels with protective stop-losses ensures prudent risk management while capturing NVIDIA’s growth trajectory.

Therefore, my recommendation is to **BUY** NVDA with a focus on gradual accumulation and vigilant monitoring of key risk factors such as the China market and partnership dynamics.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **BUY**
