After carefully analyzing the given investment plan and weighing both bullish and bearish perspectives, the evidence tilts towards caution for INTC at this juncture:

- The bullish side correctly emphasizes Intel’s strategic capital investments to future-proof itself with next-gen chips, AI, cloud, and data center tech. Technical momentum is present, suggesting investor interest.

- However, the bearish concerns about execution risk, historical operational challenges, ongoing negative free cash flow, and heavy dependency on external financing create a substantial risk profile. Overbought technical indicators and volatility spikes raise the specter of a short-term pullback.

- Furthermore, macroeconomic headwinds such as rising interest rates and geopolitical tensions increase the external risk factors threatening Intel’s turnaround.

Given these factors, prudence dictates reducing exposure rather than adding or holding aggressively. Protecting gains and limiting downside by trimming positions and setting stop-losses is a sensible risk-control approach.

Therefore, based on this comprehensive strategy that balances opportunity with risk, the optimal action is to **sell** or reduce current INTC holdings now while monitoring developments to consider reentry when stronger turnaround evidence appears.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **SELL**
